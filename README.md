## Project Overview
This project aims to develop comprehensive career counselling and guidance programs in schools to help students make informed career choices. The solution aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and focuses on providing holistic education by integrating career guidance into the school curriculum.

## Problem Statement
A lack of adequate career counselling and guidance in schools contributes to poor career choices among students, leading to mismatched skills, job dissatisfaction, and unemployment. Many students in India are unaware of the diverse career opportunities available, often leading to choices based on limited information or societal pressure.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution includes implementing comprehensive career counselling and guidance programs in schools. This includes:

### AI-Powered Career Guidance Platforms
Developing AI-driven platforms that provide personalized career advice based on students' interests, strengths, and market trends.

### Career Mentorship Programs
Establishing mentorship programs where students can receive guidance and support from professionals in their fields of interest.

### Interactive Career Exploration Tools
Creating digital tools and apps that allow students to explore different careers through virtual simulations, videos, and interactive content.
